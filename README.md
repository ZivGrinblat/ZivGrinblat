I am highly experienced with client side as well as server side development, including integrations between medium and large scale systems and data driven development.

* Relational databases: Postgres and SQLServer, noSQL databases: Mongo and Firestore
* Docker, Linux and Bash
* Serverless development with Firebase
* Real time development using webhooks and cloud events

ðŸ’¼ I worked as a fullstack developer at Ramat-Gan Municipality for an enriching and special year.

ðŸŒ¹ I volunteer to help and pay attention to people in mental distress, and as a front-end developer I take care of the ongoing maintenance of their website (client side).
